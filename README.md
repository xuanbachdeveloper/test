# Midterm Test for class JavaScript Intensive - 30/10/2022

## Introduction

For the test to day, we will work on a one of the most simple project but using React - Creating User account (Or another version for TodoList)
This project will give the experience for practical creating simple React libraries components and utilizing useState, a React hook.
You will need to write the program, based on what I have given. You are allowed the change the material following your algorithms.

## What provided to you

The project already contains some infrastructure to get you started, as follows:

-   **App.js**, **index.css**, **index.js**: These are the three pre-coded filed that I have done some pre-coded things to you. I would advice you to have a look on the **App.js** file to have the better look, but not rather to edit it.

-   Two folders **UI** and **Users** in folder **components**: In here I have created two new folders. With folder **UI** would simply stored all of your components for styling purposes, and folder **Users** would for making functionality (Creating Users, Delete users). In here I have provided some sample codes that you might want to take a look

## Coding the project

That's it. Here is some of the job that you need to work on for this project - just some little notes, but I have put some `TODO` comment as long as you can follow it. You should (or not) follow the process that I have put below here to find the way to work on better for this project

-   **npm install**: Before working on the project, please put in the folder on you machine and run `npm install`in the terminal.

-   **AddUser.jsx**: This function is seem like something is not working, try to go to this files and check the works. When you have fixed the problems. Try `npm start`

-   **UserList.jsx**: There is a problem in the CSS file. If you see, there is no hover effect on any created user. I want you to work on for every time we hover in the object. There is some styling effect on it.

-   **App.js**: After finished the hover effect, working in this files. In this file, I want you to have sorting algorithm, where we can sort userAge with ascending sort by working on the my function `addUserHandler`.

-   **deleteUser** You will need to work on the `deleteUser` functionality. Whenever you click on the user, you can delete the user information. I have not provided you the code in this section. You will need to create on your won

-   Here is the final part of this project. Create a components (you must think should it is in the **UI** or **Users** folder) called SearchBar.jsx. This components will help to you search the user that you have created.

-   Bonus point if you can work on, if you can deploy the website the Internet, do it and gain 5pt for this project.

## Submitting the Project

When you finished the coding and testing program, create a new git repository and push there. Then send the link (and might the website link) over my email `dpham4@binghamton.edu`, then you finish the work
